Clue.ai is an AI-powered learning assistant built to help students debug their code and troubleshoot lab assignments — **without ever spoiling the answer**.

Think of it as that supportive teacher who nudges you in the right direction, asks good questions, and helps you figure things out on your own. Instead of dumping a solution, Clue.ai guides you step-by-step so you actually learn the reasoning process.
